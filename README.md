Sinycamping-Octo-Shame
=======================

**Brief**

This repository contains a collection of apps we've encountered as we develop our data products within our data science specialization track. The Shiny applications are developed using RStudio and R, and we work our way through dealing with the requirements by making use of our data scientist tools. Our equipment includes those that can be accessed via the web: Plot.ly, GitHub, GitHub Pages, googleVis, Slidify, rCharts, Markdown, ShinyApps.io, Git, and R Presentations.

**Requirements**

Being able to work with R and RStudio and having some knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is quite useful. 

**Visual Reference**

There is a [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/ariesri1973/data-scientist-tools/) board containing some visualization of these tools and links to where to find them on the web.
